# source: https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/dev/pylintrc
# Reasons disabled:
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# cyclic-import - doesn't test if both import on load
# abstract-class-little-used - prevents from setting right foundation
# abstract-class-not-used - is flaky, should not show up but does
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# global-statement - used for the on-demand requirement installation
# redefined-variable-type - this is Python, we're duck typing!
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
# logging-format-interpolation - (W1202): *Use % formatting in logging functions and pass the % parameters as arguments*
# invalid-name (C0103) - *Invalid %s name "%s"%s* Used when the name doesn't match the regular expression associated to its type (constant, variable, class...).
# logging-format-interpolation (W1202): - Use % formatting in logging functions and pass the % parameters as arguments Used when a logging statement has a call form of “logging.(format_string.format(format_args...))”. Such calls should use % formatting instead, but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments.

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time. See also the "--disable" option for examples.
#enable=

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

# bad-continuation (C0330): *Wrong %s indentation%s%s.*
#   TODO
# fixme (W0511):
#   Used when a warning note as FIXME or XXX is detected.
# :locally-disabled (I0011): *Locally disabling %s (%s)*
#   Used when an inline option disables a message or a messages category.
# :missing-docstring (C0111): *Missing %s docstring*
#   Used when a module, function, class or method has no docstring.Some special
#   methods like __init__ doesnt necessary require a docstring.
# :no-init (W0232): *Class has no __init__ method*
#   Used when a class has no __init__ method, neither its parent classes.
# :redefined-builtin (W0622): *Redefining built-in %r*
#   Used when a variable or function override a built-in.
# :redefined-outer-name (W0621): *Redefining name %r from outer scope (line %s)*
#   Used when a variables name hides a name defined in the outer scope.
# :function-redefined (E0102): *%s already defined line %s*
#   Used when a function / class / method is redefined.
# :misplaced-comparison-constant (C0122): *Comparison should be %s*
#   Used when the constant is placed on the left side of a comparison. It is
#   usually clearer in intent to place it in the right hand side of the
#   comparison.
# :useless-else-on-loop (W0120): *Else clause on loop without a break statement*
#   Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break
#   statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as
#   the loop itself.
# :unbalanced-tuple-unpacking (E0632): *Possible unbalanced tuple unpacking with sequence%s: left side # has %d label(s), rightside has %d value(s)*
# :no-else-return (R1705): *Unnecessary "else" after "return"*
#   Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
#   containing a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
#   else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.
